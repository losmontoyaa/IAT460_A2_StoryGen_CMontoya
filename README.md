# Assignment 2 : Mad-Libs Style Story Generator

## How To Run:
**In order to run the project, please open using Google Colab and simply run the code block. Each time the code is run, the system will generate a new version of the story. :)**


_For Assignment 2, I opted to create a procedural story generator utilizing a generative grammar system. When Griffin first introduced generative grammar systems during the lab, they immediately reminded me of these books we used to have in elementary school called Mad-Libs books. They were a series of childrenâ€™s books which feature a skeleton outline of a story with key-elements like adjectives and characters being replaced by fill-in-the-blanks for kids to write in their own story elements often to humorous and contradicting results. I thought generative grammar systems embody that spirit quite well, and I thought I could use Mad-libs as the inspiration for the assignment in order to give whatever story is being generated a solid structure and story format, while also allowing for multiple variations of the story._
